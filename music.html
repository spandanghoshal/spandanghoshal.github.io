      <h2>Why I Play</h2>
      <p>
        Music began as a private practice and slowly became a way to serve others. The bamboo flute connects me to the
        earthy textures of folk and devotional tunes, while the harmonica brings back memories of impromptu jams with
        friends. Both instruments remind me to breathe, listen, and let the melody take the lead.

        <h3>Flute</h3>
        <p>
          I enjoy exploring classical and folk motifs on the bansuri. Most of my recordings are single-take sessions
          captured in quiet evening hours.

        <h3>Harmonica</h3>
        <p>
          The harmonica was my first companion on stage. Its portability and warmth make it ideal for spontaneous
          performances and collaborations.
