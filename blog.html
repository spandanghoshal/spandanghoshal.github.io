        I use this space to document my learning process, celebrate small wins, and connect the dots between statistics,
        music, and spiritual practice. Each post is an invitation to slow down and explore these intersections with me.

        <h3>Spirituality in the Age of AI</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">November 14, 2025 · Reflections</p>
        <p>
          Each week the news cycle heralds a new benchmark: models that compose symphonies, write proofs, or automate
          decisions that once required years of training. These advances are exhilarating, yet they also expose a quiet
          truth. If intelligence can be replicated in silicon, then intelligence alone cannot be the foundation of our
          worth. The prestige attached to material productivity becomes fragile the moment an algorithm performs the
          same task faster and cheaper.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why spiritual practice feels more relevant than ever. Through japa, study of the Gītā, and time in
          satsanga, I receive a reminder that consciousness is not a competition. The goal is not to outrun machines but
          to realign with the qualities that machines cannot imitate: compassion, surrender, and the capacity to be
          present with another being's suffering. When I begin my workday after meditation, the rush to prove myself to an
          invisible marketplace subsides. What remains is gratitude for the chance to serve, whether by writing code,
          teaching a concept, or listening to a friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence may erode the scarcity of material achievement, but it also frees us to ask deeper
          questions. What is the purpose of my intellect? How do I use it to cultivate seva rather than status? Spiritual
          traditions offer practices that keep these questions alive. They guide us to anchor identity in the eternal, not
          in metrics that can be optimized away. In that anchoring lies a joy that no algorithm can synthesize.
