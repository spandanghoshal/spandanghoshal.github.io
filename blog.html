        I use this space to document my learning process, celebrate small wins, and connect the dots between statistics,
        music, and spiritual practice. Each post is an invitation to slow down and explore these intersections with me.

        <h3>Mathematical Meditations</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">September 29, 2024 · Research Reflections</p>
        <p>
          The past few weeks have been a deep dive into a paper on change-point detection under dependent noise. The
          mathematics is intricate, and it is easy to lose clarity when proofs span several pages. What kept me grounded
          was a morning routine of chanting, pranayama, and journaling the key intuitions behind each lemma before
          touching the keyboard. This ritual not only improved my focus but also helped me communicate the ideas more
          gracefully to collaborators.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the post, I outline the steps of this routine, share a few diagrams from my notebook, and reflect on how a
          mindful approach can turn mathematical frustration into a meditative practice.

        <h3>Breathing Through the Bansuri</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">August 18, 2024 · Music &amp; Mindfulness</p>
        <p>
          My guru recently challenged me to focus on meend control within rāga Yaman, especially on the descent. I
          recorded each practice session and noticed how the quality of my tone tracked the steadiness of my breath. On
          days filled with deadlines, the tone became thinner; on restful days, it resonated.
        </p>
        <p>
          This piece documents the exercises I used to stabilize breath, how I integrated tānpura drone meditations, and
          the parallels I observed between statistical smoothness assumptions and musical phrasing. Music continues to be
          my reminder that discipline and joy can coexist.

        <h3>Change-Points in the Wild</h3>
        <p class="post-meta">July 07, 2024 · Applied Statistics</p>
        <p>
          A collaboration with a group of ecologists introduced me to a river in Assam whose health indicators had been
          monitored for over a decade. Sudden spikes in nutrient levels hinted at anthropogenic interference, and we
          needed a robust method to quantify the shifts. We deployed a nonparametric change-point algorithm that could
          handle missing data and seasonal effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project reminded me of the importance of communicating uncertainty with humility. In the post I discuss the
          modelling choices we made, how we involved local stakeholders in interpreting the results, and why statistics can
          serve as a bridge between communities and policy makers.
